# Bayesian-models-for-classification
The project explores a number of logistic regression models for binary classification. Specifically, the frequentist approach to logistic regression is compared against a number of Bayesian models including:
* Logistic regression using the Laplace approximation of the posterior distribution
* Bayesian Hierarchical models

Inference for the  Bayesian models is performed using PyStan.
